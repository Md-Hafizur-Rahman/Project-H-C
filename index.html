        <p>This is a list of people who have held the title of Caliph, the supreme religious and political leader of an Islamic
            state known as the Caliphate, and the title for the ruler of the Islamic Ummah, as the political successors to
            Muhammad. All years are according to the Common Era.

            <p>A few months before his death, the Islamic prophet Muhammad delivered a sermon to over 100,000 Muslims at the
                event of Ghadir Khumm. In the sermon, he declared Ali ibn Abi Talib to be his successor. He described Ali
                with several leadership titles in the sermon, including "Mawla," "Imam," "Ameer," and "Khalifah."[1] After
                the sermon, Muhammad instructed everyone to pledge allegiance to Ali. According to both Shia and Sunni sources,
                Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman were all among those who pledged allegiance to Ali at the event.[2][3][4] After
                Muhammad's death, however, some of Muhammad's companions left and gathered at a place known as Saqifa. At
                Saqifa, Umar pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr, despite their previous pledges of allegiance to Ali. Abu Bakr
                then assumed political power, and his supporters became known as the Sunnis. Despite that, a group of Muslims
                kept their allegiance to Ali. These people, who became known as Shias, held that while Ali's right to be
                the political leader may have been taken, he was still the religious and spiritual leader after Muhammad.</p>
